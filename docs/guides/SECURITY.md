# Security Policy

## Introduction

Security is fundamental in the development of this application. Below are the practices and policies we implement to ensure data protection and system integrity.

## Authentication and Authorization

We can use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. Users must register and verify their identity before accessing protected resources.

## Data Protection

Passwords are securely stored using the bcrypt algorithm. We do not store sensitive data in plain text.

## Input Validation and Sanitization

All user input is validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. We utilize validation libraries like [Joi](https://joi.dev/) to ensure data integrity.

## Security Configuration

CORS settings are restricted to allowed domains. Additionally, we implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to protect against XSS.

## Logging and Monitoring

Security events are logged to a file and monitored for suspicious activities.

## Updates and Maintenance

We perform regular security updates and review the code for vulnerabilities using tools like [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/).

## Contributions

Contributors should ensure to follow security practices when making changes to the code and report any vulnerabilities found.
